title: EXPERIMENT - An Open World

EXPERIMENT 2013 will showcase the **social innovations** that have been brought forth by the Free Software and the Open Source; software and also hardware innovations, artistic and organizational ones as well. Embraced as a sharing philosophy, the FLOSS movement has paved the way for **distributing knowledge** (Wikipedia, Creative Commons) and allows for new ways of learning and **experimenting** in the IT world, which have a **major impact on our everyday lives**.

During the EXPERIMENT day, there will be several **conferences and workshops** addressed **to novices** as well as to professionals that are concerned with social issues: beginning with **artistic creation** all the way to **democracy** and interconnected objects. These topics, addressed by the Free and Open Source, will allow us to further our understanding in these areas and also their application in real life.

**Children** are most welcome to test and participate, with a special schedule dedicated to them: KIDEXPERIMENT. There will be a number of **discovery workshops** for various free or open source software and hardware as well as **mini-conferences** for young people on the topics of democracy and free art.
