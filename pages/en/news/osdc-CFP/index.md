title : The OSDC Call for Participation

##5th Open Source Developers Conference in France

Montrouge Beffroi cultural centre, Paris, October 4 & 5, 2013

OSDC.fr's objective is to gather French speaking developers from different communities around innovative technologies. 
After two editions on our own, we are since 2011 associated to Open World Forum and its numerous partners 
in order to provide the best experience to our attenddees.

For the 5th edition of this conference, we invite you to gather the communities dedicated to programming based on 
free/libre languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Smalltalk & much more.

In order to submit your proposal and find out more about this CFP,
