title : D-15 - A word from Inria
date : 2013/09/20

###Patrick Moreau - Head of Open Source Strategy, Inria

"Inria has been involved for years in free/open source software (FLOSS).
 
Inria can be considered as a FLOSS provider. Indeed, approximately half of its 1,000 software is distributed under a 
FLOSS license. Most of them are research prototypes with a variable number of users and contributors to the community. 
Inria is convinced that this production deserves to be more widely known among developers and software end users. This 
would subsequently increase the impact that Inria's FLOSS production already has on society and consequently, be a source 
of value creation, in consistency with Inria's missions.  
 
For this reason, Inria is willing to take leadership in events or organizations gathering SMEs, larger companies and 
academia. For instance, Inria launched the IRILL Center in Paris in 2010 with academic partners and organizes the annual 
FOSSA conference. We are a historical OW2 member and are strongly active in clusters such as Systematic.
 
Inria is therefore proud to be the Diamond sponsor of this 6th edition and is looking forward to exchanging with economic 
actors, communities, CTO, developers, students and a large audience during tracks and on our exhibition stand.
 
A specific Rencontre Inria Industries is taking place on Friday 4th, morning. After short presentations of a sample of 
"software quality" technologies, face-to-face meeting are being planned between companies and researchers willing to 
initiate future collaboration."
