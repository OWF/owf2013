title: Open World Forum 2013 The Best Edition. Ever.

###A word from the OWF2013 President

The Best Edition. Ever.
  
We did not compromise for this year's edition of the Open World Forum. From having one of the best speaker lineup in 
Europe to tackling and discussing the complex issues, our track-leaders have really gone the extra mile. And with such 
an attendance, you can be sure to enjoy your time at the Forum and network with some of the smartest people in Free and 
Open Source Software!
 
On the THINK front, the Open World Forum is back with keynotes and panels ranging from the future of Open Source 
Foundations, the global state of Open Source Public Policies, the changes for FOSS Education with the rise of the MOOC 
platforms, to new ways of looking at procurement for Free and Open Source Software. The full schedule for the first day 
is available on our website. 
 
Stay tuned as we still have some surprise speakers to announce!
 
The CODE tracks have also been redesigned around four pillars where Free and Open Source Software is leading the market 
and keeping on innovating : the Cloud, mobile technologies, the next-generation Web platforms, and data management with 
the tracks on Big Data and NewSQL. We brought in all the best-in-class FOSS solutions so you can learn about them and 
talk to their creators and contributors.
 
The full schedule for the CODE tracks is available here.
 
We are also very glad to host additional Global Meetups on Thursday evening, such as the OpenStack Meetup, the SaltStack 
Meetup and more to be announced shortly! We will also have the pleasure of hosting the Open CIO Summit.
 
We're very excited about this Edition's program and we hope you are too! Don't forget to [register right now](http://www.openworldforum.org/registration/)
to save your free ticket.

See you there!
 
Pierre Queinnec, 2013 President
