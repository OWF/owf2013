title: Vision and guidlines for the 2013 edition od the Open World Forum
date: 2013/04/25

#### The 2013 motto of the Open World Formum is "<b>Make It Happen!</b>"

**Open World Forum** is the **first global summit** bringing together decision-makers,
communities and developers to inter-connect open-source technological, economic and
social initiatives and build the digital world of the future. The event was launched in 2008
and now takes place **annually in Paris**, with more than 200 speakers from **40 countries** and
an international audience of **2,100 participants** in 2012. The Forum’s steering organisation
brings together the main international technology communities and the major open-source
software associations of the French-speaking world (Adullact, AFUL, CNLL, PLOSS,
Silicon Sentier), with support from key institutions in Europe (European Commission) and
France (Mairie de Paris – the Paris city authority, the Paris regional authority, Paris Region
Economic Development Agency).


The Open World Forum is back for its **sixth edition**. It will be held on the **3rd, 4th and 5th
of October 2013**, and will take place in a completely new seting in order to accommodate
a larger audience. This edition will be a milestone on the way to become the **premier
global event** mixing state policies, social concerns, technology and economy. OWF will
take place at the Beffroi and will again be organized by Systematic Paris Region. More
than **3,000 attendees** are expected for this next Edition, reflecting the revised and expanded program.

### Vision and Guidelines for 2013 Program

The 2013 edition will be held in a global context where the FLOSS industry is still growing rapidly, unaffected by the current economy. For the first time, an Open-Source vendor has passed the **billion-dollar revenue mark**. **Public policies** have devoted special attention to FLOSS: in the **UK**, in **Québec** with the Bédard Plan, and in **France** with the Ayrault recommendation, to name a few. Furthermore, **emerging sectors** like mobile and cloud computing are **dominated by Open-Source**, such as the Android Operating System, and the OpenStack platform.

The new location will enable us to have **vendor booths**, long requested by sponsors. It will then be possible for sponsors and communities to **showcase their newest innovations**.

For the first time, **Engineering Schools and Universities** will be involved in the event organization, in order to showcase the **industry vitality** to graduating students. With such
a great demand on the job market and virtually no one available to hire, the full
commitment of academia is essential for the health of our ecosystem. This involvement
will also show in the **Education, Job & FLOSS** track that will put a special emphasis on
the emerging **MOOC** (Massive Open Online Courses) phenomenon, and the comparison
with the more traditional approach.

A **whitepaper** will be produced to showcase the FLOSS industry to students. It will be distributed in the partnering Engineering Schools and Universities.

Finally, a **Student “Demo Cup”** will be held to award the best students' teams working on
Open-Source projects. This will result in an **open competition between Universities**
before the event, that will widen the Open World Forum reach to the brightest and more
gifted students.

This edition will also devote particular attention to drafting more **women** as speakers.
We hope, as a side efect, that this will be a key part of making the **field look more appealing** to female students.

**Diversity**, and in particular **Woman/Man**, is one of the key elements of the Free culture
and one that is dear to this edition of Open World Forum. This year will have a
track dedicated to engaging with female students and brainstorming on how we could
have **more women enroll into Open-Source and IT curricula**.

For this edition, **women are well-represented and involved** in the organization of the
Open World Forum  with Sabrina Peseux, for the Systematic Paris-Region cluster, in
charge of the organization of the OWF, Elisabeth Racine, for the Cap Digital cluster, Vice-
President in charge of Experiment, and Véronique Torner, President of the Open CIO
Summit.

The 2013 edition will be chaired by Pierre Queinnec, who has appointed Stefane Fermigier,
Jean-Séverin Lair, Philippe Montargès and Elisabeth Racine as vice-presidents. The Open
World Forum will keep the threefold structure that has made its success; Think, Code and
Experiment. Each track will be led by a Vice-President; Philippe Montargès for Think,
Stefane Fermigier for Code, and Elisabeth Racine for Experiment. This year a **VP Users**,
Jean-Séverin Lair, brings in his **vision as a major Free Software user**, a dimension that is
essential for the 2013 program.

### Think – Make it happen!

Think will be held over the course of the two first days, and will outline the major role of
FLOSS in the digital economy. The **“Make it Happen!”** baseline very concretely sums up the focus on building a successful free and open-source strategy, from a technological and 
commercial standpoint. 


The **opening day** format will differ from the previous editions as talks will happen in a
**single-track schedule** in the largest auditorium. This enables us to concentrate on having
the best schedule in a unique plenary session, dedicated to decision-makers in the private
and public sectors. Talks will be more concise and will introduce the **think tanks andworkshops** that will be held on the **second day**.

This renewed format will support the 2013 focus: **making it happen**. The FLOSS industry 
is now at a point where we need to have IT departments **take the step from intention**, either from strategy or political decision, to **actual use or purchase**.

We will demonstrate **innovation** with FLOSS, which is accessible to **all companies and administrations**. It is nowadays easier to innovate in each market because of the availability of free and innovative technologies. This **demystifcation of practical innovation** will be the major theme of this sixth edition of the Open World Forum.

All of our speakers have **successfully innovated** with free and open-source software and
will **share their experiences** around its use and impact. Shared innovation and the
platforms available for **collaborative innovation** will be represented. More practically,
speakers will document the way they succeeded in bringing innovation through FOSS in
the following sectors:
 
* Digital economy
* Media
* Education
* Public sector
* Foundations and Communities
 

The **opening day** will be dedicated to **keynotes, conferences and panels**. The individual
talk slot format will be shorter than previous editions, so we can have a **very dynamic andattractive program**. The morning will be the opportunity to approach the **real impact** of
Open-Source in the world digital economy, as well as the **impact of state policies**, the
governance, educational and business issues. We'll end this sequence with some
**industrial, organizational, community and government successes** that might inspire
atendees to choose Free and Open-Source Software for their next projects.

The afternoon will focus on the innovation catalyst role that Open-Source plays in the
major technological and educational projects, especially in **infrastructure** and **Cloud**, in
**Big Data** and the **Hadoop** platforms, in the **Web** of tomorrow and in **Mobility**.

**CIOs** and major users of FLOSS will be invited to take part in the fifth edition of the **Open CIO Summit**, which is scheduled at the end of the day.

These topics will be explored deeper **during the second day**, through **workshops and think tanks** led by industry and community leaders. This will enable atendees to
contribute to the **evolution of our field**, and of course provide the meeting point for the
**world experts** to get together and talk about the present and future.

### Code – Open Innovation

From a technological standpoint, **during the Code day**, the focus will be on the following topics: Web, Infrastructure (Cloud, but not exclusively), Data and Mobility. The Web, especially with the user aspects, like the **UX** movement and the **Responsive Design** requirements, but also **accessibility**, a topic that will be increasingly important in the future.

**Infrastructure** is not solely a technical topic and we want to also approach it from its organizational point of view within the IT departments, with a focus on the **devops** movement, the internal impacts for development teams of the new VM provisioning platforms and technologies.

The Data topics, which include **Open Data**, and the necessary thinking to have when considering opening a data set; but also **Big Data**, the batch or semi-realtime analysis of large quantities of data and the commercial or professional advantages that we can expect.

Last, we will talk about **Mobility** as it is a vital and fast-evolving subject, that has the important characteristic to be largely dominated by Open Source with Android, Tizen, Ubuntu or FirefoxOS.

The Code topics will be led by a **track-leader team that has been almost entirely renewed**.

### Experiment - An Open World

Experiment 2013 will showcase the **social innovations** that have been brought forth by the Free Software and the Open Source; software innovations but at the same time hardware, artistic and organizational ones as well. Embraced as a sharing philosophy, the FLOSS movement has paved the way for **distributing knowledge** (Wikipedia, Creative Commons) and allows for new ways of learning and **experimenting** in the IT world, which have a **major impact on our everyday lives**.

During the Experiment day, there will be several **conferences and workshops** addressed **to novices** as well as to professionals that are concerned with social issues: beginning with **artistic creation** all the way to **democracy** and interconnected objects, the topics addressed by the Free and Open Source will allow us to further our understanding in these areas but just as well to apply them in real life.

**Children** are most welcome to test and participate, with a special schedule dedicated to them: KIDEXPERIMENT. There will be a number of **discovery workshops** for various free or open source software and hardware as well as **mini-conferences** for young people on the topics of democracy and free art.
