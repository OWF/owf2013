<a name="abilian"><a href="http://www.abilian.com/fr/" target="_blank"><img src="/static/pictures/page sponsor et organisateurs/abilian_page sponsor.png" width="400" alt="abilian"></a></a>

**Abilian** est un éditeur de logiciels open source qui propose des solutions innovantes pour votre entreprise ou
votre organisation, dans les domaines de la collaboration émergente (entreprise 2.0), des processus métiers et de la
gestion de l'information.

Une plateforme de collaboration émergente est l'outil idéal pour partager des informations, communiquer,
collaborer et dynamiser l’activité de votre organisation au quotidien.

Les réseaux sociaux d’entreprises, et autres applications “entreprise 2.0”, connaissent actuellement un engouement
irréfutable. Ainsi, les 3/4 des DRH interrogés par l’Observatoire des DRH et de la e-transformation en 2011
considèrent la mise à disposition d’un réseau social d’entreprise comme nécessaire ou souhaitable. Après la mise à
disposition d’espaces de partage documentaire collaboratif, c’est la deuxième priorité pour ces mêmes DRH.

Cet engouement s’inscrit dans un contexte général de transformation profonde de la façon dont travaillent les
entreprises à l’aube du 21ème siècle.

**Jamendo** is a music website and an open community of music authors. It bills itself as "the world's largest digital
service for free music".

Since the beginning in 2005, Jamendo's music has been licensed under Creative Commons licenses. Applied to all songs,
these licenses allow artists to publish their music and preserve their rights while providing users the freedom to
download it for free and redistribute at least noncommercially, with other permissions varying by license. The goal of
Jamendo is to be the link between artists who want to share their music and audiences around the world, both private
and professional.

At the center of Jamendo is an economic model that grants free music downloads for web users, while at the same time
providing revenue opportunities for artists through commercial uses, via the licensing platform Jamendo PRO which
sells licenses for music synchronization and background music.

Based in Luxembourg, the website has a community of 1.4 million members.

At the end of 2012, the catalog comprised 362,000 tracks by 30,000 artists from 120 countries. The site is available
in 6 languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian and Polish. The name "Jamendo" is derived from a fusion of
two musical terms: "jam session" and "crescendo".
