title: Experiment - An Open World

Experiment 2013 will showcase the **social innovations** that have been brought forth by the Free Software and the Open Source; software innovations but at the same time hardware, artistic and organizational ones as well. Embraced as a sharing philosophy, the FLOSS movement has paved the way for **distributing knowledge** (Wikipedia, Creative Commons) and allows for new ways of learning and **experimenting** in the IT world, which have a **major impact on our everyday lives**.

During the Experiment day, there will be several **conferences and workshops** addressed **to novices** as well as to professionals that are concerned with social issues: beginning with **artistic creation** all the way to **democracy** and interconnected objects, the topics addressed by the Free and Open Source will allow us to further our understanding in these areas but just as well to apply them in real life.

**Children** are most welcome to test and participate, with a special schedule dedicated to them: KIDEXPERIMENT. There will be a number of **discovery workshops** for various free or open source software and hardware as well as **mini-conferences** for young people on the topics of democracy and free art.
