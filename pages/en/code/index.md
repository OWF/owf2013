title: CODE - Open Innovation


From a technological standpoint, **during the CODE days**, the focus will be on the following topics: Web, Infrastructure (Cloud, but not exclusively), Data and Mobility. The Web, especially with the user aspects, like the **UX** movement and the **Responsive Design** requirements, but also **accessibility**, a topic that will be increasingly important in the future.

**Infrastructure** is not solely a technical topic and we want to approach it from its organizational point of view within the IT departments as well, with a focus on the **devops** movement, the internal impacts for development teams of the new VM provisioning platforms and technologies.

The Data topics, which include **Open Data**, and the necessary thinking to have when considering opening a data set; but also **Big Data**, the batch or semi-real time analysis of large quantities of data and the commercial or professional advantages that we can expect.

Lastly, we will talk about **Mobility** as it is a vital and fast-evolving subject, that has the important characteristic to be largely dominated by Open Source with Android, Tizen, Ubuntu or FirefoxOS.

The CODE topics will be led by a **track-leader team that has been almost entirely renewed**.
